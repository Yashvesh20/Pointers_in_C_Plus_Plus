# Software Required:
Visual Studio
# Theory:

A pointer is a special variable that holds the memory address of another variable, rather than storing a direct value itself. Pointers allow programs to access and manipulate data in memory efficiently, making them a key feature for system-level programming and dynamic memory management.

Assign Address:
The addressof operator (&) determines the address of any variable in C++. 
Dereferencing:
The process of accessing the value present at the memory address pointed by the pointer is called dereferencing. The (*) Symbol is used for Dereferencing.

Pointers are a useful concept in C++ that allow direct access to memory addresses, providing greater control over memory and data manipulation. 

+ Implementing Data Structures: Pointers are used to implementing complex data structures such as linked lists, trees, and graphs, where elements are dynamically allocated and linked together.

+ Pass Arguments by Pointer: Pass the argument with their address and make changes in their value using pointer. So that the values get changed into the original argument.


# Implementation:
Pointers in C++ were implemented using the following codes,
+ Increment of pointers
+ Addition or Subtraction of Pointers
+ Reversing an Array using a Pointer
+ Printing a String using Pointer

# Algorithms:
Reverse an Array Using Pointers



# Conlusion:
The concept of pointers were implemented using  codes in C++.
